Product Details
This is a power full tool. Which help you to create thousands of sample image from a single picture. Within a few minutes. which help you to train your AI Machin With help of Data Augmentation. 
Data augmentation in data analysis are techniques used to increase the amount of data by adding slightly modified copies of already existing data or newly created synthetic data from existing data. It acts as a regularize and helps reduce overfitting when training a machine learning model.

Data augmentation is a strategy that enables practitioners to significantly increase the diversity of data available for training models, without actually collecting new data. Data augmentation techniques such as cropping, padding, and horizontal flipping are commonly used to train large neural networks.

The performance of deep learning neural networks often improves with the amount of data available. Data augmentation is a technique to artificially create new training data from existing training data. ... This means, variations of the training set image that are likely to be seen by the model.
